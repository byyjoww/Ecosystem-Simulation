# Ecossystem Simulation Experiment

- Experimented with GOAP (Goal Oriented Action Planning) by creating an ecossystem simulation, containing carnivores, herbivores and plants.
- Animals are given a list of goals, and requirements + rewards associated with those goals.
- The animals will choose a goal from the list using the A* algorythm, based on their current state.
